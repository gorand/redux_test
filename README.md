React and Redux web application
[Demo](http://gorand.github.io/redux_test)

### Overview

This is yet another React and Redux based web application starter kit. However, this one attempts to go beyond the typical simple boilerplates, by showcasing several great technologies (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), [Babel](http://babeljs.io), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)) used together to develop a more complex web application, with features such as authentication, navigation, asynchronous data fetching, error handling, caching and pagination, etc.
